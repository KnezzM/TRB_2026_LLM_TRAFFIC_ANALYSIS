Okay, let's analyze the simulation results to identify the best traffic management scenarios for the Second Avenue corridor, considering the trade-offs between vehicle, bus, and pedestrian performance across different times of the day.

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Overview:**

*   **DELAYAVG:** Average delay is a primary indicator of congestion. Lower values are better.
*   **TRAVTMTOT:** Total travel time reflects the overall efficiency of the corridor. Lower values are better.
*   **STOPSTOT:** Total stops indicate the smoothness of traffic flow. Fewer stops are desirable.

**General Observations:**

*   **FIELD vs. Other Scenarios:** The "FIELD" scenario (existing conditions) generally has higher delay and travel times for vehicles compared to many of the implemented scenarios, suggesting that the new technologies are having a positive impact overall.
*   **Fixed-Time (FT & TSP+FT):** Fixed-time control scenarios (FT and TSP+FT) generally perform worse than actuated control scenarios, especially for vehicles, indicating that responsiveness to real-time traffic conditions is beneficial.
*   **Transit Signal Priority (TSP):** Scenarios with TSP generally improve bus performance (lower delay and travel time) compared to scenarios without TSP, as expected.
*   **Pedestrian Impact:** Scenarios with pedestrian recall (PR) or exclusive pedestrian phases (EP) tend to increase vehicle delays, as they interrupt the vehicle flow more frequently. Passive pedestrian detection (PPD) aims to mitigate this by only serving pedestrian phases when needed.

**Time-of-Day Analysis:**

To recommend scenarios, we need to look at each time period separately. I will focus on scenarios that show improvements for vehicles without significantly degrading bus or pedestrian performance.

*   **AM Peak:**
    *   `TSP+AC+PPD`: This scenario consistently shows the lowest vehicle delay (35.76 seconds) and total travel time (14702.75 seconds) compared to FIELD (58.50 seconds and 19406.98 seconds) and FT (55.54 seconds and 18773.13 seconds). Bus and pedestrian delays are also reasonable.
    *   `TSP+GLOSA(10)+AC+PPD`, `TSP+GLOSA(20)+AC+PPD`, `TSP+GLOSA(30)+AC+PPD`: These GLOSA scenarios also show significant improvements in vehicle delay and total travel time compared to FIELD and FT.
*   **Midday:**
    *   `TSP+AF+PPD+PGE+EP`: This scenario shows the lowest bus delay (33.73 seconds) and total travel time (171.33 seconds).
    *   `TSP+AC+PPD`: This scenario shows the lowest vehicle delay (30.79 seconds) and total travel time (9291.25 seconds).
*   **PM Peak:**
    *   `TSP+GLOSA(20)+AC+PPD`: This scenario shows the lowest vehicle delay (49.94 seconds) and total travel time (16771.27 seconds).
    *   `TSP+AC+PPD`: This scenario shows the lowest vehicle delay (50.33 seconds) and total travel time (21362.28 seconds).
*   **Evening:**
    *   `TSP+AF+PPD`: This scenario shows the lowest vehicle delay (27.42 seconds) and total travel time (6744.84 seconds).

**Specific Scenario Considerations:**

*   **Actuated Coordinated Control (AC):** Generally a good choice, providing a balance between responsiveness and coordination. Adding PPD further refines this by reducing unnecessary pedestrian phases.
*   **Green Light Optimal Speed Advisory (GLOSA):** GLOSA shows promise in reducing vehicle delay and travel time, especially during the AM and PM peaks. The different percentage values (10%, 20%, 30%) don't show a clear trend, so further investigation might be needed to determine the optimal setting.
*   **Actuated Free Control (AF):** AF can be effective in off-peak periods (Evening), where coordination is less critical. However, it might lead to disruptions during higher traffic volumes.
*   **Rest-in-Red (RIR):** RIR might be suitable for low-volume periods or intersections with infrequent demand, but the data doesn't show a clear advantage in this corridor.

**Recommendations:**

Based on the simulation results, here are my recommendations for implementation, keeping in mind the need for a balanced approach:

*   **AM Peak:** Implement `TSP+AC+PPD` or `TSP+GLOSA(20)+AC+PPD`. These scenarios significantly reduce vehicle delays and travel times while maintaining reasonable performance for buses and pedestrians.
*   **Midday:** Implement `TSP+AC+PPD`. This scenario provides the best balance of performance for all modes during this off-peak period.
*   **PM Peak:** Implement `TSP+GLOSA(20)+AC+PPD` or `TSP+AC+PPD`. These scenarios offer the best trade-off between vehicle, bus, and pedestrian performance during the PM peak.
*   **Evening:** Implement `TSP+AF+PPD`. This scenario minimizes vehicle delays and travel times during the evening period when traffic volumes are lower.

**Final Answer:**

For optimal performance across all modes, I recommend the following: `TSP+AC+PPD` or `TSP+GLOSA(20)+AC+PPD` for AM peak, `TSP+AC+PPD` for Midday, `TSP+GLOSA(20)+AC+PPD` or `TSP+AC+PPD` for PM peak, and `TSP+AF+PPD` for the Evening. These scenarios offer the best trade-offs among vehicle, bus, and pedestrian performance for each time of day.-------------------------------------------------------------------- ANSWER END --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. CoT:

-------------------------------------------------------------------- ANSWER START --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. **Understand the Question**: The question asks for the best-performing scenarios considering the trade-offs between vehicle, bus, and pedestrian performance across different times of day (TODs). The goal is to identify scenarios suitable for real-world implementation.

2. **Summarize the Data**: The data provides performance metrics (DELAYAVG, DELAYSTOPAVG, STOPSTOT, TRAVTMTOT) for vehicles, buses, and pedestrians under various scenarios and time periods. Lower values generally indicate better performance. Due to the extensive data, it's important to focus on the most significant improvements across all modes.

3. **Compare Dimensions**:
    *   **AM Peak**: The `TSP+AC+PPD` and `TSP+GLOSA(30)+AC+PPD` scenarios show the most promise, with lower vehicle delays compared to the FIELD and FT scenarios. Bus delays are also slightly reduced. Pedestrian delays are comparable.
    *   **Midday**: The `TSP+AF+PPD+PGE+EP` scenario stands out with the lowest bus delay and vehicle delay. Pedestrian delay is slightly higher than other scenarios.
    *   **PM Peak**: The `TSP+GLOSA(20)+AC+PPD` scenario appears to offer a good balance, with reduced vehicle delays and reasonable bus and pedestrian performance.
    *   **Evening**: The `TSP+AF+PPD` and `TSP+RIR+PPD+PGE` scenarios show the lowest vehicle delay.

4. **Interpret the Results**:
    *   The scenarios with Actuated Coordinated control (`AC`) and Transit Signal Priority (`TSP`) generally perform better than Fixed-Time control (`FT`) or existing field conditions (`FIELD`), as they dynamically adjust to traffic demand.
    *   Green Light Optimal Speed Advisory (`GLOSA`) shows potential for reducing vehicle delays, especially during peak hours, by optimizing vehicle speeds.
    *   Actuated Free control (`AF`) can be effective during off-peak hours (Midday and Evening) when coordination is less critical.
    *   Rest-in-Red (`RIR`) can improve efficiency during periods of low demand, particularly in the evening.
    *   Exclusive Pedestrian Phase (`EP`) tends to increase vehicle delays, but it can improve pedestrian safety and reduce pedestrian delay.

5. **Conclude Clearly**:
    For implementation, `TSP+AC+PPD` and `TSP+GLOSA(30)+AC+PPD` are recommended for the AM peak, `TSP+AF+PPD+PGE+EP` for midday, `TSP+GLOSA(20)+AC+PPD` for the PM peak, and `TSP+AF+PPD` or `TSP+RIR+PPD+PGE` for the evening, as these scenarios offer the best trade-offs among vehicle, bus, and pedestrian performance during their respective time periods.

-------------------------------------------------------------------- ANSWER START --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Okay, I will analyze the simulation results and scenario descriptions to identify the best traffic control strategies for the Second Avenue corridor, considering the trade-offs between vehicle, bus, and pedestrian performance.

**1. Analyze the Baseline (FIELD) and Fixed-Time (FT) Scenarios:**

The "FIELD" scenario represents the existing conditions with a pre-existing fixed-time control plan and pedestrian recall. The "FT" scenario also uses fixed-time control. Comparing these provides a baseline for evaluating other strategies.

Here's a summary of the FIELD scenario performance:

| Time Period | Mode        | DELAYAVG (s) | STOPSTOT |
|-------------|-------------|----------------|----------|
| AM          | Vehicles    | 58.50          | 636.08   |
| AM          | Buses       | 59.02          | 4.67     |
| AM          | Pedestrians | 6.42           | 3.67     |
| MD          | Vehicles    | 42.45          | 311.25   |
| MD          | Buses       | 47.81          | 5.00     |
| MD          | Pedestrians | 7.94           | 9.67     |
| PM          | Vehicles    | 51.84          | 516.42   |
| PM          | Buses       | 66.03          | 4.92     |
| PM          | Pedestrians | 13.79          | 14.25    |
| EVE         | Vehicles    | 42.13          | 177.67   |
| EVE         | Buses       | 79.93          | 2.25     |
| EVE         | Pedestrians | 6.33           | 6.58     |

**2. Evaluate Advanced Scenarios**

Now, let's examine the scenarios that aim to improve upon the baseline:

*   **TSP+AC+PPD**: This scenario uses Actuated Coordinated control, Transit Signal Priority, and Passive Pedestrian Detection. The AC control adjusts green times based on real-time demand, while TSP prioritizes buses that are behind schedule. PPD serves pedestrians only when detected.

    *   Compared to FIELD, TSP+AC+PPD generally shows a **reduction in vehicle delay** across all time periods. For example, in the AM peak, vehicle delay drops from 58.50s (FIELD) to 35.76s.
    *   Bus delay is also slightly reduced in the MD period (47.81s to 39.63s), but can be higher in the PM period (66.03s to 69.98s).
    *   Pedestrian delay is slightly higher in MD and PM, likely due to PPD skipping phases when no pedestrians are detected, but lower in AM and EVE.

*   **TSP+AC(TFT)+PPD**: This is similar to the previous scenario, but the actuated coordinated control is timed for transit, meaning the coordination is optimized for bus speeds (10 mph).

    *   This scenario shows a further **reduction in vehicle delay** in the AM period compared to TSP+AC+PPD (41.64s vs 35.76s).
    *   Bus delay is comparable to TSP+AC+PPD.
    *   Pedestrian delay is slightly higher than TSP+AC+PPD in the AM period.

*   **TSP+AC+PPD+PGE**: This scenario adds Pedestrian Green Extension to TSP+AC+PPD. PGE extends the green time if pedestrians are still in the crosswalk.

    *   Vehicle delay is slightly higher than TSP+AC+PPD, likely due to the green extension.
    *   Bus delay is similar to TSP+AC+PPD.
    *   Pedestrian delay is slightly lower than TSP+AC+PPD, likely due to the green extension improving pedestrian clearance.

*   **TSP+AC+PPD+PGE+EP**: This scenario adds an Exclusive Pedestrian Phase to TSP+AC+PPD+PGE. EP stops all vehicle traffic to allow pedestrians to cross in all directions.

    *   Vehicle delay is higher than all other scenarios, due to the exclusive pedestrian phase interrupting vehicle flow.
    *   Bus delay is also higher, especially in the PM period.
    *   Pedestrian delay is comparable to TSP+AC+PPD+PGE.

*   **TSP+GLOSA(x)+AC+PPD**: This scenario incorporates Green Light Optimal Speed Advisory (GLOSA) with varying penetration rates (x%). GLOSA advises drivers on optimal speeds to avoid stopping at red lights.

    *   As the penetration rate of GLOSA increases, vehicle delay generally decreases. For example, in the AM peak, vehicle delay decreases from 36.02s (20% penetration) to 35.63s (10% penetration).
    *   Bus delay is comparable to TSP+AC+PPD.
    *   Pedestrian delay is comparable to TSP+AC+PPD.

*   **TSP+AF+PPD**: This scenario uses Actuated Free control, which means the signals respond fully to traffic demand without coordination.

    *   Vehicle delay is lower than FIELD and FT, but higher than TSP+AC+PPD.
    *   Bus delay is lower than FIELD and FT.
    *   Pedestrian delay is lower than FIELD and FT.

*   **TSP+AF+PPD+PGE+EP**: This scenario adds Pedestrian Green Extension and Exclusive Pedestrian Phase to TSP+AF+PPD.

    *   Vehicle delay is higher than TSP+AF+PPD, due to the pedestrian phases.
    *   Bus delay is lower than FIELD and FT.
    *   Pedestrian delay is comparable to TSP+AF+PPD.

*   **TSP+RIR+PPD**: This scenario uses Rest-in-Red control, where the signal remains red until a vehicle or pedestrian is detected.

    *   Vehicle delay is lower than FIELD and FT, but higher than TSP+AC+PPD.
    *   Bus delay is lower than FIELD and FT.
    *   Pedestrian delay is higher than FIELD and FT.

*   **TSP+RIR+PPD+PGE**: This scenario adds Pedestrian Green Extension to TSP+RIR+PPD.

    *   Vehicle delay is similar to TSP+RIR+PPD.
    *   Bus delay is lower than FIELD and FT.
    *   Pedestrian delay is lower than FIELD and FT.

**3. Recommendations**

Based on the simulation results and scenario descriptions, here are my recommendations for each time period:

*   **AM Peak**:
    *   **TSP+AC+PPD**: Offers a good balance of reduced vehicle delay and reasonable bus and pedestrian performance.
    *   **TSP+GLOSA(x)+AC+PPD**: If a significant percentage of vehicles are equipped with GLOSA technology, this scenario can further reduce vehicle delay.
    *   **TSP+AC(TFT)+PPD**: This scenario prioritizes transit progression, which may be beneficial if transit is a major priority during the AM peak.

*   **Mid-Day (MD)**:
    *   **TSP+AC+PPD**: Provides the best overall performance for all modes.
    *   **TSP+AF+PPD+PGE+EP**: This scenario provides the best pedestrian performance.

*   **PM Peak**:
    *   **TSP+AC+PPD**: Offers a good balance of reduced vehicle delay and reasonable bus and pedestrian performance.
    *   **TSP+GLOSA(x)+AC+PPD**: If a significant percentage of vehicles are equipped with GLOSA technology, this scenario can further reduce vehicle delay.

*   **Evening (EVE)**:
    *   **TSP+AC+PPD**: Provides the best overall performance for all modes.
    *   **TSP+AF+PPD**: This scenario provides the best vehicle performance.

**4. Considerations**

*   **Pedestrian Recall vs. Passive Pedestrian Detection**: Scenarios with pedestrian recall (like the FIELD scenario) serve pedestrians every cycle, regardless of demand. This can lead to unnecessary delays for vehicles and buses when no pedestrians are present. PPD improves efficiency by only serving pedestrians when they are detected. However, it may slightly increase pedestrian delay if pedestrians are not detected promptly.
*   **Exclusive Pedestrian Phase**: While the exclusive pedestrian phase (EP) improves pedestrian safety and convenience, it significantly increases vehicle and bus delays. This should only be implemented at intersections with extremely high pedestrian volumes.
*   **GLOSA Penetration Rate**: The effectiveness of GLOSA depends on the penetration rate of equipped vehicles. A higher penetration rate will result in greater benefits.

**5. Conclusion**

The **TSP+AC+PPD** scenario generally offers the best trade-offs among vehicle, bus, and pedestrian performance for all time periods. It reduces vehicle delay compared to the existing conditions while maintaining reasonable performance for buses and pedestrians. The **TSP+GLOSA(x)+AC+PPD** scenario can further improve vehicle performance if a significant percentage of vehicles are equipped with GLOSA technology. The **TSP+AC(TFT)+PPD** scenario can be considered if transit progression is a major priority. The exclusive pedestrian phase should only be implemented at intersections with extremely high pedestrian volumes due to its significant impact on vehicle and bus delays.

Description:  
This scenario reflects the existing field conditions and serves as the baseline for comparison with all other configurations. It operates using a pre-existing Fixed-Time (FT) control plan developed prior to this project. No advanced ITS or adaptive technologies are implemented. Pedestrian service operates under Recall mode, meaning pedestrians are served every cycle regardless of detection. The signal operates in a coordinated mode across the corridor.

Key Features:  
- Baseline condition for performance comparison  
- Fixed-Time control (pre-project plan)  
- Pedestrian Recall (served every cycle)  
- Signal coordination across intersections

Scenario Name: TSP+GLOSA(x%)+AC+PPD  
Full Name: TRANSIT SIGNAL PRIORITY + GREEN LIGHT OPTIMAL SPEED ADVISORY + ACTUATED COORDINATED CONTROL + PASSIVE PEDESTRIAN DETECTION

Time Periods: AM, PM  
Applicable Modes: Vehicles, Buses, Pedestrians

Description:  
This scenario implements an Actuated Coordinated (AC) signal control strategy with timing parameters recalculated based on updated traffic demand data. Vehicle detectors are deployed at intersection approaches to enable demand-responsive green time allocation. Approaches without detected demand are skipped, allowing more green time for higher-volume movements and improving overall operational efficiency.

Transit Signal Priority (TSP) is integrated as a cloud-based ITS system that monitors real-time bus schedule adherence. When a bus is behind schedule, the system dynamically adjusts the signal state at the next intersection—extending green or shortening red phases as needed. These interventions are applied locally at each intersection.

In addition, the scenario introduces Green Light Optimal Speed Advisory (GLOSA) technology. GLOSA uses SPaT (Signal Phase and Timing) data broadcast from Roadside Units (RSUs) to calculate optimal speed profiles. These are communicated to drivers through aftermarket On-Board Units (OBUs) in connected vehicles. The goal is to reduce unnecessary stops, minimize abrupt deceleration, and promote smoother driving patterns. This not only enhances travel time reliability but also helps reduce fuel consumption and emissions. The impact of GLOSA varies with penetration rate `x%`, representing the proportion of vehicles equipped with GLOSA-capable OBUs.

Pedestrian service operates under Passive Pedestrian Detection (PPD), meaning pedestrians are served only when presence is detected. Signal coordination is preserved along the corridor to ensure consistent progression for vehicles and transit.

Key Features:  
- Actuated Coordinated signal control (demand-responsive)  
- Coordinated operations across intersections  
- Transit Signal Priority (cloud-based, schedule-responsive logic)  
- Green Light Optimal Speed Advisory (SPaT-based speed recommendations)  
- Variable GLOSA penetration rate (`x%`)  
- Passive Pedestrian Detection (presence-based pedestrian service)

Scenario Name: TSP+AC+PPD+PGE+EP  
Full Name: TRANSIT SIGNAL PRIORITY + ACTUATED COORDINATED CONTROL + PASSIVE PEDESTRIAN DETECTION + PEDESTRIAN GREEN EXTENSION + EXCLUSIVE PEDESTRIAN PHASE

Time Periods: AM, PM  
Applicable Modes: Vehicles, Buses, Pedestrians

Description:  
This scenario implements an Actuated Coordinated (AC) signal control strategy with signal timings recalculated based on updated traffic demand data. Vehicle detectors are installed at intersection approaches to dynamically allocate green time based on detected presence. Low-demand approaches are skipped, allowing additional green time to be allocated to high-volume movements, thus improving corridor efficiency.

Transit Signal Priority (TSP) is deployed as a cloud-based system that monitors real-time bus schedule adherence. When a bus is behind schedule, the system modifies the signal state at the upcoming intersection by either extending the green or shortening the red phase. These adjustments are localized to each intersection.

Pedestrian service operates under Passive Pedestrian Detection (PPD), meaning pedestrians are served only when presence is detected. Signal coordination is maintained to support vehicle and bus progression throughout the corridor.

The Pedestrian Green Extension (PGE) feature enhances pedestrian safety by extending the green time of the current vehicle phase if slow-moving pedestrians are still within the crosswalk at the end of their walk phase. During the extension, the "Don't Walk" signal remains active to prevent new pedestrians from entering, and conflicting vehicular movements are held. While effective for safety, this feature may introduce additional delay, especially on minor streets.

Additionally, this scenario introduces an Exclusive Pedestrian Phase (EP), which provides pedestrians the opportunity to cross in all directions (including diagonal) while all vehicle movements are stopped. This phase is activated based on high pedestrian demand at specific intersections. While it improves pedestrian crossing opportunities and safety, it increases vehicle delay due to the complete halt of vehicle traffic during the pedestrian-only phase.

Key Features:  
- Actuated Coordinated signal control (demand-responsive)  
- Coordinated signal operations across the corridor  
- Transit Signal Priority (cloud-based, schedule-responsive logic)  
- Passive Pedestrian Detection (presence-based service)  
- Pedestrian Green Extension (clearance extension for slow pedestrians)  
- Exclusive Pedestrian Phase (all-direction pedestrian movement, including scramble crossings)

Full Name: TRANSIT SIGNAL PRIORITY + ACTUATED COORDINATED CONTROL (TIMED FOR TRANSIT) + PASSIVE PEDESTRIAN DETECTION

Time Periods: AM, PM
Applicable Modes: Vehicles, Buses, Pedestrians

Description:  
This scenario implements an Actuated Coordinated (AC) signal control strategy that is timed specifically to favor transit progression. Signal coordination offsets are calculated based on an average bus travel speed of 10 mph to improve bus progression through the corridor. Actuated coordination is still in effect, with detectors installed on intersection approaches to enable demand-responsive green time allocation. Approaches without detected demand are skipped, allowing the system to prioritize movements with higher volume.

Transit Signal Priority (TSP) is deployed as a cloud-based system. It monitors real-time bus schedule adherence and intervenes when a bus is behind schedule by dynamically extending the green phase or shortening the red at the next signal, depending on its current state. These adjustments are performed locally at each intersection.

Pedestrian service is provided through Passive Pedestrian Detection (PPD), meaning pedestrians are only served when their presence is detected, unlike Recall mode which serves them every cycle. Coordinated signal timing remains active across the corridor to preserve progression for all modes.

Key Features:  
- Actuated Coordinated signal control (with demand-based detection)  
- Transit-favoring coordination (timed to bus speed of 10 mph)  
- Skips low-demand phases to optimize efficiency  
- Passive Pedestrian Detection (presence-based service)  
- Transit Signal Priority (cloud-based, schedule-responsive logic)
