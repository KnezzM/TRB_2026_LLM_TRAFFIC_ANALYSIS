Question: Which scenarios offer the best trade-offs among vehicle, bus, and pedestrian performance for each time of day, and can be recommended for implementation?

Human Analysis:
The simulation results across all TOD periods indicate that no single scenario optimally serves all modes simultaneously. However, several strategies provide a strong compromise between minimizing vehicle and bus delay while ensuring acceptable pedestrian performance. The following summarizes the recommended trade-off scenarios per TOD:
AM Period:
Recommended Scenario: TSP + Actuated Coordinated Control + Passive Pedestrian Detection
Justification:
During the AM period, traffic along the Second Avenue corridor exhibits strong directional demand, particularly in the northbound direction, where coordinated signal progression is essential for maintaining flow. The combination of TSP with Actuated Coordinated Control and Passive Pedestrian Detection provides the most effective strategy for balancing multimodal performance under these peak conditions. Actuated Coordinated Control maintains green progression along the primary direction while dynamically adjusting to real-time vehicle and pedestrian presence, ensuring minimal disruption from side streets. Passive Pedestrian Detection further enhances efficiency by only servicing pedestrian phases when demand is present, thereby preserving green time for vehicles and transit. TSP integration enables preferential treatment for buses without compromising overall coordination. Simulation results confirmed that this configuration yields the lowest vehicle and bus delays, maintains reliable travel times, and achieves acceptable pedestrian service levels, making it the most suitable solution for the AM peak.
PM Period:
Recommended Scenarios: 
•	TSP + Actuated Coordinated Control + Passive Pedestrian Detection
•	TSP + Fixed-Time Control
Justification:
During the PM period, the Second Avenue corridor experiences directional peak traffic, with particularly high demand in the southbound direction. The preferred strategy of TSP + Actuated Coordinated Control + Passive Pedestrian Detection provides the most consistent and corridor-wide performance across all user groups by maintaining signal progression in both directions while dynamically adjusting to vehicle and pedestrian demand. This configuration ensures low overall delay, smooth transit flow, and acceptable pedestrian service, even under complex multimodal conditions. Actuated Coordinated Control preserves green bands where needed, while Passive Pedestrian Detection prevents unnecessary servicing of side-street pedestrian phases, reducing unwarranted interruptions to arterial flow. TSP effectively prioritizes buses without sacrificing system efficiency, ensuring fewer stops and lower delay.
However, simulation results indicated that TSP + Fixed-Time Control performed notably well for southbound bus travel time, benefiting from predictable signal timings and well-structured progression. This fixed-time strategy may be a practical alternative in scenarios with highly stable, unidirectional flows, such as PM southbound coordination, where minimal side-street demand limits the penalty of fixed phasing.
Still, TSP + Actuated Coordinated Control + Passive Pedestrian Detection remains the superior corridor-wide choice for the PM period due to its ability to adapt to real-time fluctuations, support multimodal demand, and deliver balanced benefits across all approaches—something Fixed-Time cannot achieve without sacrificing flexibility and responsiveness in less predictable segments of the corridor.
Midday Period:
Recommended Scenario: 
•	TSP + Actuated Coordinated Control + Passive Pedestrian Detection
•	TSP + Actuated Free Control + Passive Pedestrian Detection
Justification:
During the Midday period, traffic demand on the Second Avenue corridor is relatively low and non-directional, with more intermittent bus and pedestrian activity. The recommended strategy, TSP + Actuated Coordinated Control + Passive Pedestrian Detection, offers the most stable and reliable corridor-wide performance by preserving signal progression while dynamically serving pedestrian and side-street demand only when needed. This strategy consistently minimized vehicle delay, maintained predictable travel times, and ensured balanced multimodal operations. Although pedestrian delay was slightly higher than under recall-based systems, Passive Pedestrian Detection effectively optimized the trade-off between pedestrian responsiveness and system efficiency, particularly by avoiding unnecessary phase activations at low-volume crosswalks.
As an alternative, TSP + Actuated Free Control + Passive Pedestrian Detection delivered the best results for bus delay and number of stops, largely due to its responsiveness and phase-skipping logic. The flexibility of Actuated Free Control allowed TSP to operate better, granting priority without the constraints of coordinated progression. This made it highly effective at improving transit performance under light traffic.
However, this benefit came at the cost of slightly more variability in vehicle delay and reduced mainline signal progression. Therefore, if transit operations are the primary objective, Actuated Free Control with TSP is preferable. But for balanced performance across all modes, especially when maintaining progression and travel time reliability is critical, Actuated Coordinated Control with Passive Pedestrian Detection is the more robust midday strategy.
Evening Period:
Recommended Scenario: 
•	TSP + Actuated Coordinated Control + Passive Pedestrian Detection
•	TSP + Rest in Red + Passive Pedestrian Detection
Justification:
During the Evening period, traffic volumes and pedestrian activity decline, but directional flows and multimodal service needs remain present. The recommended strategy, TSP + Actuated Coordinated Control + Passive Pedestrian Detection, demonstrated the most consistent and reliable performance across all metrics. The coordinated signal operation preserved mainline progression, even under lower demand conditions, while Passive Pedestrian Detection ensured pedestrian phases were served efficiently without unnecessary disruptions. This approach balanced pedestrian service, bus reliability, and vehicle flow, making it well-suited for maintaining network stability during transitional, variable-volume conditions typical of the evening.
As an alternative, TSP + Rest-in-Red Control + Passive Pedestrian Detection performed comparably well for bus operations, particularly in reducing stop delay and the number of stops. The Rest-in-Red strategy was effective at minimizing unnecessary green time allocations during periods of intermittent demand. This increased the responsiveness of TSP, especially when combined with Passive Pedestrian Detection, making it an efficient option for low-volume, pedestrian-sensitive intersections.
However, Rest-in-Red lacked the consistent corridor-wide coordination of the Actuated Coordinated strategy, occasionally leading to variability in travel time and delay, particularly for general-purpose vehicles. Therefore, while Rest-in-Red may be suitable for localized intersections or transit-focused operations in the Evening, Actuated Coordinated Control with Passive Pedestrian Detection remains the most reliable and system-efficient solution for comprehensive corridor-level implementation.

Okay, I will analyze the simulation results and scenario descriptions to identify the best traffic control strategies for the Second Avenue corridor, considering the trade-offs between vehicle, bus, and pedestrian performance.

**1. Analyze the Baseline (FIELD) and Fixed-Time (FT) Scenarios:**

The "FIELD" scenario represents the existing conditions with a pre-existing fixed-time control plan and pedestrian recall. The "FT" scenario also uses fixed-time control. Comparing these provides a baseline for evaluating other strategies.

**2. Evaluate Advanced Scenarios**

Now, let's examine the scenarios that aim to improve upon the baseline:

*   **TSP+AC+PPD**: This scenario uses Actuated Coordinated control, Transit Signal Priority, and Passive Pedestrian Detection. The AC control adjusts green times based on real-time demand, while TSP prioritizes buses that are behind schedule. PPD serves pedestrians only when detected.

    *   Compared to FIELD, TSP+AC+PPD generally shows a **reduction in vehicle delay** across all time periods. For example, in the AM peak, vehicle delay drops from 58.50s (FIELD) to 35.76s.
    *   Bus delay is also slightly reduced in the MD period (47.81s to 39.63s), but can be higher in the PM period (66.03s to 69.98s).
    *   Pedestrian delay is slightly higher in MD and PM, likely due to PPD skipping phases when no pedestrians are detected, but lower in AM and EVE.

*   **TSP+AC(TFT)+PPD**: This is similar to the previous scenario, but the actuated coordinated control is timed for transit, meaning the coordination is optimized for bus speeds (10 mph).

    *   This scenario shows a further **reduction in vehicle delay** in the AM period compared to TSP+AC+PPD (41.64s vs 35.76s).
    *   Bus delay is comparable to TSP+AC+PPD.
    *   Pedestrian delay is slightly higher than TSP+AC+PPD in the AM period.

*   **TSP+AC+PPD+PGE**: This scenario adds Pedestrian Green Extension to TSP+AC+PPD. PGE extends the green time if pedestrians are still in the crosswalk.

    *   Vehicle delay is slightly higher than TSP+AC+PPD, likely due to the green extension.
    *   Bus delay is similar to TSP+AC+PPD.
    *   Pedestrian delay is slightly lower than TSP+AC+PPD, likely due to the green extension improving pedestrian clearance.

*   **TSP+AC+PPD+PGE+EP**: This scenario adds an Exclusive Pedestrian Phase to TSP+AC+PPD+PGE. EP stops all vehicle traffic to allow pedestrians to cross in all directions.

    *   Vehicle delay is higher than all other scenarios, due to the exclusive pedestrian phase interrupting vehicle flow.
    *   Bus delay is also higher, especially in the PM period.
    *   Pedestrian delay is comparable to TSP+AC+PPD+PGE.

*   **TSP+GLOSA(x)+AC+PPD**: This scenario incorporates Green Light Optimal Speed Advisory (GLOSA) with varying penetration rates (x%). GLOSA advises drivers on optimal speeds to avoid stopping at red lights.

    *   As the penetration rate of GLOSA increases, vehicle delay generally decreases. For example, in the AM peak, vehicle delay decreases from 36.02s (20% penetration) to 35.63s (10% penetration).
    *   Bus delay is comparable to TSP+AC+PPD.
    *   Pedestrian delay is comparable to TSP+AC+PPD.

*   **TSP+AF+PPD**: This scenario uses Actuated Free control, which means the signals respond fully to traffic demand without coordination.

    *   Vehicle delay is lower than FIELD and FT, but higher than TSP+AC+PPD.
    *   Bus delay is lower than FIELD and FT.
    *   Pedestrian delay is lower than FIELD and FT.

*   **TSP+AF+PPD+PGE+EP**: This scenario adds Pedestrian Green Extension and Exclusive Pedestrian Phase to TSP+AF+PPD.

    *   Vehicle delay is higher than TSP+AF+PPD, due to the pedestrian phases.
    *   Bus delay is lower than FIELD and FT.
    *   Pedestrian delay is comparable to TSP+AF+PPD.

*   **TSP+RIR+PPD**: This scenario uses Rest-in-Red control, where the signal remains red until a vehicle or pedestrian is detected.

    *   Vehicle delay is lower than FIELD and FT, but higher than TSP+AC+PPD.
    *   Bus delay is lower than FIELD and FT.
    *   Pedestrian delay is higher than FIELD and FT.

*   **TSP+RIR+PPD+PGE**: This scenario adds Pedestrian Green Extension to TSP+RIR+PPD.

    *   Vehicle delay is similar to TSP+RIR+PPD.
    *   Bus delay is lower than FIELD and FT.
    *   Pedestrian delay is lower than FIELD and FT.

**3. Recommendations**

Based on the simulation results and scenario descriptions, here are my recommendations for each time period:

*   **AM Peak**:
    *   **TSP+AC+PPD**: Offers a good balance of reduced vehicle delay and reasonable bus and pedestrian performance.
    *   **TSP+GLOSA(x)+AC+PPD**: If a significant percentage of vehicles are equipped with GLOSA technology, this scenario can further reduce vehicle delay.
    *   **TSP+AC(TFT)+PPD**: This scenario prioritizes transit progression, which may be beneficial if transit is a major priority during the AM peak.

*   **Mid-Day (MD)**:
    *   **TSP+AC+PPD**: Provides the best overall performance for all modes.
    *   **TSP+AF+PPD+PGE+EP**: This scenario provides the best pedestrian performance.

*   **PM Peak**:
    *   **TSP+AC+PPD**: Offers a good balance of reduced vehicle delay and reasonable bus and pedestrian performance.
    *   **TSP+GLOSA(x)+AC+PPD**: If a significant percentage of vehicles are equipped with GLOSA technology, this scenario can further reduce vehicle delay.

*   **Evening (EVE)**:
    *   **TSP+AC+PPD**: Provides the best overall performance for all modes.
    *   **TSP+AF+PPD**: This scenario provides the best vehicle performance.

**4. Considerations**

*   **Pedestrian Recall vs. Passive Pedestrian Detection**: Scenarios with pedestrian recall (like the FIELD scenario) serve pedestrians every cycle, regardless of demand. This can lead to unnecessary delays for vehicles and buses when no pedestrians are present. PPD improves efficiency by only serving pedestrians when they are detected. However, it may slightly increase pedestrian delay if pedestrians are not detected promptly.
*   **Exclusive Pedestrian Phase**: While the exclusive pedestrian phase (EP) improves pedestrian safety and convenience, it significantly increases vehicle and bus delays. This should only be implemented at intersections with extremely high pedestrian volumes.
*   **GLOSA Penetration Rate**: The effectiveness of GLOSA depends on the penetration rate of equipped vehicles. A higher penetration rate will result in greater benefits.

**5. Conclusion**

The **TSP+AC+PPD** scenario generally offers the best trade-offs among vehicle, bus, and pedestrian performance for all time periods. It reduces vehicle delay compared to the existing conditions while maintaining reasonable performance for buses and pedestrians. The **TSP+GLOSA(x)+AC+PPD** scenario can further improve vehicle performance if a significant percentage of vehicles are equipped with GLOSA technology. The **TSP+AC(TFT)+PPD** scenario can be considered if transit progression is a major priority. The exclusive pedestrian phase should only be implemented at intersections with extremely high pedestrian volumes due to its significant impact on vehicle and bus delays.
